# Mullen_stock
Website created to give information about the Mullen Stock trading in the US Market

This first project is done under the Code Institute program to accredit the Full Stack development course as part of the Weiterbildung granted by the German Employ Agency. 

The project aims to show the skills learned during this first stage of the course, with emphasis on HTML and CSS. 

This project has the sole intention of demonstrating the skills learned in the course and has no profit motive or plagiarism of any author's work. Everything used as images, graphics and external information will be properly credited to its author. Tolerance is requested if any information is omitted. 


The name of the page will be Mullen_Stock. The idea of this project is to inform all those investors who participate in the stock market, specifically with the Mullen Automotive stock. This stock is traded on both the US and German stock exchanges, for the purpose of not duplicating information, this page will focus on the stock traded in the US under the acronym MULN.

The purpose of this page is to inform about the status of the stock and to provide its investors with a support page to better realize their investments. The use and management of the site will be 100% informational and is not intended to provide any financial advice. 

The page will contain basic information about the stock, a small description of the company, as well as information that is useful for investors such as news and milestones of the company through links to its official social media. It is intended that new users will have a basic idea of the stock and help improve their decision making on whether or not to invest in this stock.

At the end of the website, a small formular is stablish for the purpose of inviting those who already trade the stock to join the community or those who are not part of it to express if they have any interest.

In this file you will find the main page of the project which is made up of an image as filename "pexels-deva-darshan-1173777.jpg". This file comes from the free stock: www.pexels.com. 

The content is a welcome to visitors interested in knowing about the MULN (Muln automotive) stock. Two texts are shown here "Because we love the stock" which alludes to an immediate approach to those who already trade the stock and approaches those who do not know it yet. The secondary text is "Informative website...". This text is intended to clarify the content and purpose of the page. 

In this section and audio control was also added just to demonstrate what was learnt in the course, the audio was taken from the Code institute program to avoig copyright problems (http://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/HTMLEssentials/btn-audio.mp3). The Audio is introduced with a normal controls set up which can be first played by the user and will not automatically be played when the web page is loaded by the browser.

information.html

In this section of Information about Mullen, 4 boxes are identified with some descriptive information about the company Mullen Automotive, its battery as a banner in its long term trading; its interpretation as a Stock meme whose scope has made it a trend topic within the most traded stocks last year; and finally the description of what DD means to those outside of stock trading.  

Each section is a copy-paste of information obtained from other web pages, whose link is referenced for later search and/or to avoid author problems. 

Finally as background there is a stock image named: pexels-pixabay-315938.jpg from the same website: www.pexels.com.

news.html

In the news.html file there are links through icons obtained free of charge through the web page: https://fontawesome.com/.

These icons were embedded in the code itself, as well as the script that Font awesome gives you use inside all the files. 

As mentioned, the links open an external page that leads directly to each of the official Mullen Automotive accounts. The purpose of this page is to give those interested in learning more about the MULN action a place where they can find out official news and follow the accounts within their personal accounts.

member.html

Finally the last file created: member.html 
It is a place to connect with the user. This code is similar to the one used during the Code Institute's Love Running Walkthrough Project Challenge: Signup Form Signup Form. It is for this reason that inside the "Form" the action command is kept as "https://formdump.codeinstitute.net/". 

The page has a content with an image named: pexels-matheus-bertelli-799443.jpg obtained for free from the same page: www.pexels.com , as the images of the whole document. 

The information to fill in the form asks for basic information such as name, surname, e-mail address and gives the option to know if the user already has shares and plans to hold them in the long term, or trades them on a daily basis and if the user does not participate at all in the trading of the share. 

It should be noted that the information collected is not in the hands of the person who wrote the code. Therefore, it is not recommended to fill out the information as it is only for informational purposes for the creation of the page within the first Code Institute project.
